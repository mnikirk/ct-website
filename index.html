                    <p class="lead">ConsulTech is a privately-held company based in Bloomington, Indiana. Founded in 1995 by two technologist/entrepreneurs from Indiana University, the company established a profitable niche by providing network connectivity and support to its clients, a significant number of whom were in the real estate industry. In continuous operation since 1995, ConsulTech is one of Bloomington's oldest internet service providers (ISPs).</p>
                    <!-- <p class="lead">In 2003, <a class="text-light" href="https://www.envisagenow.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ENVISAGE Technologies Corporation</a> was spun-off from ConsulTech to split the product/service palette into two companies, each focusing on its core competency. The primary focus of ENVISAGE was in developing large-scale training and human capital management systems, primarily for state and federal government. In early 2004, a new CEO was brought in to bring renewed focus to ConsulTech as a technology outsourcer for small and medium sized businesses and not-for-profits in South Central Indiana.</p> -->
